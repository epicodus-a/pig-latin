# Pig Latin

### Description
- A website to convert common string to pig latin, Mar 28th, 2018

By Adriana and Joy

### Specs
- The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels.
  - Example Input: 3
  - Example Output: 3
  
- The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel.
  - Example Input: i
  - Example Output: iay

- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
  - Example Input: orange
  - Example Output: orangeway

- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
  - Example Input: chris
  - Example Output: rischay

- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
  - Example Input: quite
  - Example Output: itequay

- For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
  - Example Input: yahoo
  - Example Output: ahooyay
